## What is this website?

Howdy!

COVID-19 Information for TAMU Students by a Student was created to serves the needs of Texas A&M University's College Station student body. This page does not provide medical instruction or advice, but it here to help students find the information they need most. 

Since the first introduction of COVID-19 into the world, waves of procedures, warnings, and instructions have been released to inform citizens with the most up-to-date information. COVID-19 Information for Students by a Student is meant to reduce the gap between that information and a Texas A&M student. On this website, users will be able to find resources for campus guidelines, schedule changes, links to local resources, and much more with ease. With such a wide array of information and different online resources, the goal of this page is to create a central hub for students to become informed about any COVID-19 related subject.

Thanks and Gig'em!
